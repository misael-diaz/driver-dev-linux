linux driver development codecamp

## compile the module

to compile the module simply issue the following command on the console:

```sh
make
```

if you want to clean up, then use

```sh
make clean
```

## load the driver module

insert the module via the command as root user:

```sh
insmod ldd.ko
```

## verify that the driver module was loaded

```sh
lsmod | grep ldd
```

if we don't see the `ldd` driver listed something has gone wrong

## write operation

```sh
echo "msg" > /proc/ldd_driver
```

## read operation

```sh
cat /proc/ldd_driver
```

## check kernel messages

```sh
dmesg
```

we should see all the output generated by `printk()` by our driver

## unload the driver module

```sh
rmmod ldd
```

note that we don't need to use the `.ko` file extension here and that only root can do
this

## references

the code is based mostly on this codecamp
